# LibUI

This is a fork of [libui-ng](https://github.com/libui-ng/libui-ng), which is in turn a fork of
[libui](https://github.com/andlabs/libui).

## About

LibUI is a simple and portable (but not inflexible) GUI library in C that uses the native GUI technologies of each
platform it supports.

This fork is a complete overhaul and redesign of the library that brings it up to date with the latest programming
standards. There is absolutely no intention of maintaining backward-compatibility with previous operating systems,
nor of maintaining compatibility with the original LibUI library.

The original library was nearing one-thousand "TODO" items scattered throughout its source code. This fork closes
**_all_** of those items. Many of them had long since been abandoned, with links to documentation or websites that
no longer exist, making it very difficult, if not impossible, to follow through with whatever instructions were left
behind by previous developers.

It also enables modern features, like high DPI and dark-mode awareness on Windows, giving it a more modern look and
feel.

## Documentation

The documentation for this library is designed to be read in its source code repository, or in your IDE. If you
have an IDE that can render Markdown files, switch to its render/preview mode, and follow the links below to get
started.
